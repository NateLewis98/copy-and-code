        <h3>Your Website Should Sell as Hard as You Do</h3>
  <p>Most small business websites look fine but say nothing. I build landing pages with copy that turns visitors into 
    customers — and code that makes it all look effortless.</p>
    

    <h3>What I Do</h3>
    <p><span class="bold">Landing Pages That Convert.</span>
You don't need a 12-page website. You need one great page that makes your phone ring. I'll build it and write
 every word on it.</p>

 <p><span class="bold">Copywriting That Sells.</span>
Good design gets attention. Good copy closes the deal. I write headlines, CTAs, and body copy that move people
 from "just browsing" to "take my money."</p>

 <p><span class="bold">Web Design for Small Business.</span> Clean, fast, mobile-friendly sites built from scratch.
     No bloated templates. No WordPress plugins breaking at 2 AM.
 Just a site that works and looks like you paid way more than you did.</p>

 <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p><span class="bold">Eau Claire Guitar Academy.</span>
A local guitar instructor needed a site that matched his reputation. I built a conversion-focused landing page with
 persuasive copy, real student testimonials, and a booking form. The result: a professional online presence that fills
  lesson spots.</p>

  <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I'm Nate — a copywriter turned web developer based in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Most developers can build you a site
         but can't write a sentence. Most copywriters can write but can't build anything. I do both.</p>

    <p>Your site gets copy that actually persuades and code that actually works. One person. One invoice.
         No game of telephone between a writer and a developer who've never met.</p>
<h3>Testimonial</h3>
    <p>Nate built our site from scratch and nailed it. He understood what we needed before we did. &mdash; Shane Yetter</p>

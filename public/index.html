        <h3>Your Website Should Sell as Hard as You Do</h3>
  <p>Most small business websites look fine but say nothing. I build landing pages with copy that turns visitors into 
    customers &mdash; and code that makes it all flow effortlessly.</p>

    <h3>What I Do</h3>
    <p><strong>Landing Pages That Convert.</strong>
You don't need a 12-page website. You need one great page that floods you with prospects who are already sold. I'll build
 it and write every word on it.</p>

 <p>Need more than one page? Every page I build follows the same rule: no
dead weight. Every headline earns attention. Every paragraph pulls the
reader deeper. Every page ends with one clear next step for your
visitor to take. Whether it's one page or twelve, nothing goes on your
site that doesn't move the needle.</p>
    

 <p><strong>Copywriting That Sells.</strong>
Words do the heavy lifting. I write headlines that hook instantly, body copy that 
builds desire, and calls to action that make saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; feel like a 
mistake. Good design stays out of the way and lets the copy do its job.</p>

 <p><strong>Web Design for Small Business.</strong> Clean, fast, mobile-friendly sites built from scratch.
     No bloated templates. No WordPress plugins breaking at 2 AM.
 Just a site that works and looks like you paid way more than you did.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p><strong>Eau Claire Guitar Academy.</strong>
    A local guitar instructor needed a site that matched his reputation. I built a conversion-focused landing page with
    persuasive copy, real student testimonials, and a booking form. The result: a professional online presence that fills
    lesson spots.</p>

  <h3>About</h3>

    <div>
    <p>I'm Nate &mdash; a copywriter turned web developer based in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Most developers can build you a
 site but can't write a sentence. Most copywriters can write but can't build anything. I do both.</p>

<p>Your site gets copy that persuades and converts, wrapped in code that loads fast and looks sharp on every screen.
 One person. One invoice. No game of telephone between a writer and a developer who've never met.</p>

<p>I trained under direct response legends who taught me one thing above all else: every word on a page
 has one job &mdash; move the reader closer to action. That philosophy drives every headline, every paragraph,
 and every page I build. If a word doesn't earn its place, it gets cut.</p>

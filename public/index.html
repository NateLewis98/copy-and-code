        <h2>Where Persuasive Copy Meets Elegant Design</h2>
    </header>

    <main>
  <p>Hero Section: A punchy headline and one-liner. Something like "Websites that sound as good as they look"
     or "Copy + Code for small businesses that want to grow." Then a CTA button — "See my work" or "Let's talk."</p>

    <p>What I do — Two or three short blurbs covering your services. Website builds, conversion-focused copywriting,
         landing pages. Keep each one to two sentences max, focused on the result the client gets.</p>

    <p>Portfolio — Shane's site front and center with a screenshot and a brief description of what
         you delivered and why it works. As you build more projects, add them here.</p>

    <p>About — Now you introduce yourself. A few sentences: your name, what you bring to the table, why you're different
         (the copy + code angle). This is where the photo goes. Keep it warm and confident, not resume-y.</p>

    <p>Testimonial — Ask Shane for a quick quote about working with you. Even one testimonial beats zero.</p>

    <p>Contact/CTA — A simple form or just your email. End with a clear call to action.</p>
